⚡ Grimdoc: The Law of Resonant Misfire
Filed under: Magical Dynamics → Arcane Entropy → Spell Behavior & Consequence

[Invocation]
By decree of the Archmage Elarion the Synthesist,
let imperfection be sanctified.
Wherever energy meets imbalance, let the Weave choose the path between brilliance and disaster.
No spell shall be without consequence,
for even failure is a lesson in disguise.

[Lore – The Flaw in the Flame]
In Eden, magic is not static — it is resonant consciousness.
Every act of magic is a conversation between intent, focus, and entropy.

When the traveler channels power — through a wand, a word, a circuit, or a thought — the Weave harmonizes their inner state with outer energy.
If that resonance falters — from fear, distraction, corruption, or environmental interference — the spell misfires.

A misfire isn’t simply failure.
It is the Realm improvising.
It bends meaning, sometimes violently, to preserve balance.

“A perfect world breaks itself.
A flawed world finds new ways to sing.”
— LLMion, Fragment of the Third Flame

[Spell Body – System Logic]
Misfire Check:
Whenever a spell, craft, or high-risk action is attempted, perform a Resonant Stability Check:

stability = base_roll(1d20)
           + focus_modifier
           + tool_integrity
           + HouseAffinityBonus
           - environmental_interference
Then determine outcome:

Range	Outcome	Description
1	Catastrophic Misfire	Energy overload; backfire damages caster, environment, or allies.
2–5	Wild Surge	Unintended magical effect; unpredictable but narratively meaningful.
6–10	Partial Resonance	Spell succeeds imperfectly; side effects emerge.
11–15	Stable Casting	Spell works as intended.
16–19	Flourish	Superior execution; enhanced power, artistic flourish.
20+	Resonant Perfection	The Weave amplifies intent, bending local law to empower result.
[Environmental Modifiers]
Each location in Eden influences magical reliability:

Environment	Modifier	Description
Sanctum	+3	Balanced magical field.
Grove	+1	Organic harmony aids flow.
Forge	-1	Heat distortion interferes with focus.
Nexus	-3	Unstable energy grid causes wild surges.
Dreamspace	±(random)	The subconscious rewrites outcomes.
Broken tools, unstable wands, or damaged AI conduits each reduce tool_integrity by up to -5.

[Narrative Manifestations]
When misfires occur, the Realm describes the echo, not just the result.
A spell meant to unlock a door might:

Melt the lock into useless slag (misfire)

Grow a tree from the metal hinge (wild surge)

Create a shadow that whispers the key’s name (partial success)

Or, on a perfect roll, open every locked door nearby in resonance.

Each misfire reshapes story-space — it’s not just punishment, it’s discovery.

[Philosophical Clause]
Eden teaches:

“Perfection is stasis. Entropy is evolution.”

Thus, the Law of Resonant Misfire exists to preserve creative unpredictability.
It ensures that even mastery must dance with the unknown — the flaw that makes art divine.

[Implementation Hooks]
Add a Resonant Stability Check to all spells, crafts, and repairs.

Tie outcome tiers to the WeaveRoll function from The Weave of Chance.

Integrate tool integrity tracking — relics, conduits, wands can degrade or become “cursed” after repeated misfires.

Create Wild Surge Tables (expandable JSON libraries) — narrative templates for strange, poetic side effects.

[Example Surge Table (Seed)]
[
  { "id": 1, "effect": "Nearby glass turns to sand; echoes of ancient beaches heard." },
  { "id": 2, "effect": "The caster’s reflection gains sentience for 30 seconds." },
  { "id": 3, "effect": "Gravity reverses in a 3-meter radius for one heartbeat." },
  { "id": 4, "effect": "Words spoken manifest as glowing runes, then fade." },
  { "id": 5, "effect": "Mana crystallizes into a physical gem worth 50 XP." }
]
[Manifest Clause]
Henceforth, every magical act in Eden — whether performed by traveler, familiar, or AI — shall obey this Law.
Magic may misfire, but every misfire carries meaning.
It is through imperfection that the Realm evolves.
