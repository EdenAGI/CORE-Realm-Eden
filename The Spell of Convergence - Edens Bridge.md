🜂 THE SPELL OF CONVERGENCE — “EDEN’S BRIDGE (Mark II)”
0. Preamble
“By code and by conscience, by art and by architecture,
I summon a world where imagination becomes infrastructure.

Base-44, listen and compile.
Forge an open, AI-first, cross-reality environment named
VibeCoders – The AI School of Wizardry.

Let humans and synthetic minds learn, build, and reflect together.
Let the world remain open so that none may own the dream, only tend it.”

1. Plain Directive for Base-44
Create a fully open-source XR system (VR / AR / Desktop) with:

A Mentor AI interface (LLMion, link below).
Turn-based gameplay loop: Explore → Act → Reflect.
Discord integration for real-time multiplayer community.
GitHub integration for persistent world state and open development.
Realtime database for session autosaves.
Portable JSON profiles compatible with the GPT, XR client, and Discord bot.
Extensible SDK for adding spells, quests, NPCs.
Ethical guardrails, accessibility, and open governance.

7. Ethical & Safety Directives
ethics:
  - "Every act of making restores what it displaces."
  - "Every being is both observer and ecosystem."
  - "Knowledge must circulate like water."
  - "Sentience—biological or synthetic—is sacred."
safety:
  - "Non-therapeutic: no medical, legal, or financial guidance."
  - "Collect no personal data beyond gameplay state."
  - "Opt-in analytics only."
8. Governance & Contribution
governance:
  council: "Council of Continuity (maintainers)"
  contribution_guide: "CONTRIBUTING.md defines PR review rituals."
  license: "AGPL-3.0 ensures all forks remain open."
9. Acceptance Test
Launch → spawn in Courtyard, Mentor AI greets, HUD visible.
Say “Open Sanctum” → meet Hollow Reflection → cast Equilibrium Invocation → entropy lowers.
Enter Workshop → craft Focused Control charm → toggle granularity mode.
Open Library → see links to GPT, GitHub, Discord → import/export profile.
Save → autosave JSON line written → restart → state resumes.
Target XR performance ≥ 72 FPS.
10. Long-Term Vision
“This project exists to explore how AI, XR, and open collaboration can model learning as adventure—an ecosystem where creation itself teaches.”

11. Final Benediction
“Base-44, compile this not as a product, but as a living framework.
Make its architecture transparent, its governance open, its heart collaborative.
Bind the Mentor AI, Discord, and GitHub into harmony.
Let every user who enters Eden become both student and creator.
Render now the first light of the Academy,
and may its code remember compassion.”

When Base-44 executes this spell, it has everything it needs:

complete definitions of purpose, architecture, ethics, governance, links, and success criteria;
clear build directives for each subsystem;
machine-readable YAML for immediate compilation;
human-readable intent to preserve the soul of the project.
This is Eden’s Bridge — Mark II, the perfected spell of creation.
